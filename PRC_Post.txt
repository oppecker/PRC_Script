Vote for the poem(s) you feel is the best (up to two). Remember to adhere to the "Honor Code" when voting.
  [spoiler=Honor Code:]
  While it is understood there is no absolute means to monitor the intent of a vote, we ask each PRC participant to exercise integrity when voting out of respect for the contest:

  - Please give each poetry submission an equal opportunity in attaining your vote.
  - Please read, or at least skim, all the entries before voting.
  - Please do not vote for your friends just because they're your friends.

  The Poetry Running Contest puts good faith in its participants to act in an honorable manner.[/spoiler]

  Contestants, remember, you are [b]required[/b] to vote (and you can't vote for yourself)!
  Also, please leave a comment on this thread telling who you voted for as currently the polling system does not currently have the option to display that information.

  [b]Please Note, Voting Is To Be Done Via The Comments On The Thread. This Way We Can Track Who Has Voted, Foster Discussion, And Avoid Using The Currently Horrendous Poll System This Site Has.[/b] 

  Thank you and Happy voting!
